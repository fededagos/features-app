In the features explorer, you will find interactive plots to navigate the waveform features and discharge statistics of the mouse optotagged (labelled) neurons of the C4 dataset. Each plot offers insights into the corresponding feature types, helping users explore the properties of neuronal classes  in detail.

The features are computed directly from the published `.h5` databases [(which can be downloaded here)](https://c4-database.com/apps/download){target="_parent"} using [NeuroPyxels](https://github.com/m-beau/NeuroPyxels){target="_blank"}.

# 1 - Features glossary

Here is a short summary of all the features included in the dashboard visualisations. 

The exact code used to computed them is in [`npyx.feat`](https://github.com/m-beau/NeuroPyxels/blob/master/npyx/feat.py).

:::{.callout-note}
The features listed below are not used as an input to the C4 cell-type classifier. The purpose of the feature explorer is to offer an easily interpretable window on the neurons included in the C4 ground-truth database.

### > Waveform features

::: {.column-margin}
![Schematic of single-channel waveform features](example_wvf.svg){.lightbox}
:::

Waveform features are measured on the peak channel waveform, or on the largest axonal non-peak-channel waveform. 
They are computed from spikes occurring during portions of each recording without any optogenetic stimulation or synaptic blocker.
The exact code to compute them is in [`npyx.feat.waveform_features`](https://github.com/m-beau/NeuroPyxels/blob/9abd8fdb623a91ba34e45bce25d6f6529f81f475/npyx/feat.py#L1197).

- *Depolarisation amplitude (µV)*: Voltage difference between the baseline and the peak of the depolarization phase of the action potential.
- *Repolarisation amplitude (µV)*: Voltage difference between the baseline and the peak of the repolarization phase of the action potential.
- *Waveform duration (ms)*: Duration between the peak depolarization and the peak repolarization, providing an estimate of spike duration.
- *Peak-trough ratio*: Ratio between the depolarisation and repolarization amplitudes.
- *Recovery slope (µV/ms)*: Rate of voltage change from the repolarisation peak back to the baseline.
- *Spatial decay (%/24µm)*: Percentage reduction in spike depolarisation amplitude from the peak channel to the closest channels (within 24 µm, which is the distance between diagonally adjacent Neuropixels 1.0 channels).


### > Discharge statistics

Temporal features are computed using portions of each recording without any optogenetic stimulation or synaptic blocker. 
The exact code used to compute them is in [`npyx.feat.compute_isi_features`](https://github.com/m-beau/NeuroPyxels/blob/9abd8fdb623a91ba34e45bce25d6f6529f81f475/npyx/feat.py#L219).

- *Mean FR (spikes/s)*: Average firing rate of the neuron. It is the inverse of the mean of the inter-spike intervals (ISIs).
- *Mean inst. FR (spikes/s)*: Average instantaneous firing rate. It is the mean of the inverse of the ISIs.
- *Entropy (bits/s)*: Measure of the variability in the firing rate, expressed in bits per second.
- *CV2*: A measure of the irregularity of inter-spike intervals, considering only adjacent intervals. It is the average coefficient of variation for a sequence of 2 ISIs.
- *CV*: Coefficient of variation, quantifying the overall variability in inter-spike intervals. It is the ISI standard deviation divided by the ISI mean.
- *Instantaneous irregularity*: Degree of fluctuation in firing rate over short timescales. It is computed as the average of the absolute difference between the natural logarithms of 2 consecutive ISIs.
- *Local variation*: LvR is a metric used to quantify the irregularity of neuronal firing patterns that's highly invariant to firing rate fluctuations. It measures local variations in interspike intervals to characterize neural activity as regular, random, or bursty across different functional areas of the cerebral cortex. See [here](https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000433).
- *Revised local variation*: Updated version of local variation with enhanced sensitivity to changes in spiking patterns. See [here](https://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000433).
- *Log CV*: Logarithmic transformation of the coefficient of variation (taking the logarithm of ISIs).
- *ISI skewness*: Asymmetry in the distribution of inter-spike intervals, revealing bursting or regular firing.
- *Burst ratio*: Ratio of the maximum value of the autocorrelogram in the first 4 ms (i.e. a burst) to the mean firing rate.


# 2 - Features explorer

In the feature explorer, you can customize which features to display and decide whether to show them in their raw or normalized values. This flexibility allows you to analyze the data based on your specific needs and preferences.

:::{.callout-tip}
For all plots, a dropdown menu allows you to select the dataset being visualized. This feature is useful for focusing on specific subsets of the database or comparing data across datasets.
:::

All plots are generated using Plotly for Python. Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The second quartile (Q2, i.e., the median) is marked by a line inside the box. The fences growing outward from the boxes' edges span +/- 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR: Q3-Q1).

Hovering over single data points will show additional details about the selected cell, such as its specific feature values and dataset information. Clicking on a point will highlight that cell across features, allowing you to see how different values fit within the feature distributions.

Additionally, clicking on a cell will reveal and fix further plots about it at the bottom of the page, under the main graph.

:::{.column-margin .callout-note}
Afer clicking on a cell to highlight it, wait a couple seconds for the graph to update before attempting any further interaction with the dashboard.
:::

On top of this plotly plots come with several built-in interactive features:

- **Hover information**: Hover over data points to see detailed feature values and other related information.
- **Zooming**: Click and drag to zoom into a specific area, or use the zoom buttons in the modebar
- **Reset view**: Double-click any empty area in the plots to reset the view to default
- **Interactive legend**: Click items in the legend to hide/show specific groups or datasets. Double click on an element in the legend to show only data for that element

The modebar (top-right of each plot) provides additional tools for interacting with the plots, including:

- **Download**: Save the plot as a PNG file using the camera icon
- **Pan**:  Use this tool to drag the plot area and focus on specific sections without zooming in or out
- **Box select**: Select multiple points by dragging a rectangle
- **Lasso select**: Select points by drawing a custom shape
- **Autoscale**: Automatically adjusts the plot to fit all data points within the view
- **Reset axes**: Resets the axis ranges back to their original defaults for better visualization
