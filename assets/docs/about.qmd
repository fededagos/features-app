## The C4 database and classifier

This website accompanies our paper describing  the generation of the C4 database and its utilization to build a cerebellar cell-type classifier: [Beau et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.01.041).

The **C4 database** is a dataset consisting of ground-truth recordings of different types of cerebellar neurons obtained using Neuropixels probes in awake mice. 
The ground-truth identification was established using the optotagging approach, which combines optogenetic activation of specific cell types (using the appropriate Cre lines) with pharmacological synaptic blockade to confirm direct optogenetically-triggered responses. Layer information was determined using [Phyllum](https://github.com/blinklab/Phyllum_public), a custom analysis tool that accurately identifies cerebellar layers from electrophysiological recordings. The database includes carefully curated recordings of 202 neurons: 69 Purkinje cells simple spike units, 58 Purkinje cells complex spike units, 27 molecular layer interneurons, 18 Golgi cells, and 30 mossy fibers.

The **classifier** uses a semi-supervised deep learning approach that combines unsupervised pre-training with supervised classification. It first uses variational autoencoders trained on a large unlabeled dataset (3,090 neurons) to reduce the dimensionality of both spike waveforms and three-dimensional autocorrelograms (3D-ACGs). These compressed representations, along with layer information, serve as inputs to a supervised classifier trained on the ground-truth dataset. The classifier generates confidence-calibrated predictions by averaging outputs across model initializations. 
As describer in the paper, when requiring a confidence ratio above 2 (ratio of highest to second-highest predicted probability), the classifier achieves >95% accuracy for predicting cell type on the ground-truth dataset. It also generalizes well to expert-classified recordings from both mice and monkeys, demonstrating its ability to be used across species and experimental setups.

## The cerebellum cell-types classification collaboration (C4)

The **Cerebellum Cell-types Classification Collaboration (C4)** is a multi-institutional effort to create a database of cerebellar cell-types and use it to build a cell-type classifier for general use in the cerebellar neuroscience community. 
The name also refers to the involvement of teams across four universities (HÃ¤usser and Clark lab at University College London, Cohen at Bar-Ilan University, the Lisberger and Hull labs at Duke University, and the Medina lab at Baylor College of Medicine).
